"I want to build a mobile-first digital banking app called NeoFin that functions in real-time for both users and admins. The app should have two interfaces:

User App (Mobile)

Features:

User onboarding with KYC (document upload, OCR verification).

Account management (balance, transaction history, statements).

P2P payments, bill payments, airtime purchase.

Virtual debit card generation (using APIs like Stripe Issuing).

Real-time notifications for transactions (success/failure).

AI-driven fraud detection to flag suspicious transactions.

Personalized financial insights (e.g., spending trends, budget alerts).

Admin Dashboard (Web)

Features:

Real-time monitoring of all user activities (transactions, logins, etc.).

Ability to resolve failed transactions manually.

Fraud alert management (view flagged transactions, approve/block).

Manual KYC approval/rejection.

Analytics dashboard (e.g., total users, transaction volume, revenue).

Technical Requirements:

The app should be real-time (e.g., using WebSockets or server-sent events).

Use React Native for the mobile app and React.js for the admin dashboard.

Backend: Node.js or Python/Django with REST APIs.

Database: PostgreSQL for structured data and Redis for real-time caching.

AI/ML: Integrate a fraud detection model (e.g., Random Forest or LSTM) using Python (Scikit-learn/TensorFlow).

Cloud: Deploy on AWS or Azure using Docker/Kubernetes for scalability.

APIs: Use Stripe for payments, Plaid for bank linking, and Twilio for SMS notifications.

Deliverables:

A detailed system architecture diagram.

Step-by-step implementation plan (frontend, backend, ML, deployment).

Code snippets for key features (e.g., real-time notifications, fraud detection).

Recommendations for testing (e.g., load testing for 1k transactions/sec).

Please provide a clear roadmap and technical guidance to build this project from scratch."

This prompt is detailed and structured, ensuring the AI understands the scope, requirements, and deliverables for both the user-facing mobile app and the admin dashboard. It also emphasizes real-time functionality, which is critical for fintech applications.
